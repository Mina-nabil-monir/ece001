<b><h3><u><p style="color:orange"> The future of Artificial Intelligence</p></u></h3></b>
<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is on the rise in both business and the world in general. How does this work for your long-term business? Certainly, artificial intelligence can take up long-term tasks and the normal things that hinder your employees, but at what cost?</p>
<p>With AI spending expected to reach $ 46 billion by 2020, according to the report, there is no sign of this technology slowing. Adding AI to your business may be the next step while looking for ways to improve your operations and increase your performance :- </p>
<p>To understand how AI will affect your business in the future, there are 10 concerns about AI, and the reasons why AI is either harmful or beneficial to society.</p>

<ol>
  <b><li>It enhances efficiency and productivity</li></b>
  Concerns about devastating technologies are common. A recent example of this is cars - it took years to develop legislation to regulate the industry to make it safe. However, artificial intelligence today is a huge benefit to society because it enhances our efficiency and production, while creating new opportunities for income generation, cost savings and job creation.
 <b><li>It adds jobs and strengthens the economy</li></b>
 We all see the headlines: robots and artificial intelligence will destroy jobs. This is fiction and not reality. Artificial intelligence encourages a gradual development in the labor market, which, with the right preparation, will be a positive thing. People will still work, but they will do better with the help of artificial intelligence. The unique combination of man and machine will become the new normal in the workforce in the future.
<b><li>It enhances our lifestyle</li></b>
The presence of artificial intelligence in our society will enhance our lifestyle and will create more efficient businesses. Some routine and regular tasks like answering emails and entering data will be performed by smart assistants. Smart homes will also reduce energy use and provide a better level of security, marketing will become more targeted and we will get better health care thanks to better diagnosis.
<b><li>Supervising telemedicine learning</li></b>
Artificial intelligence is a technique that can be used for both good and bad purposes, so care is needed. The latest technologies seem to usually apply to the wealthiest of us, but AI has the potential to extend knowledge and understanding to a larger population - for example, image-based AI diagnosis can allow medical conditions for a more comprehensive deployment of telemedicine.
<b><li>Increasing automation</li></b>
There will be economic consequences for the widespread adoption of machine learning and other techniques of artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence is able to perform tasks that previously required extensive human labor or were not possible at all. The main benefit of the business will be to lower the operating costs caused by AI automation - whether it's positive for the community not yet seen.
<b><li>It raises the state of humanity</li></b>
The ability of technology to solve more problems, answer more questions and innovate with a number of inputs and information that exceed the ability of the human brain can certainly be used for good or evil. If history is evidence, then technology improvement tends to raise the human condition and allow us to focus on high-quality jobs and improving quality of life.
<b><li>Improves demand side management</li></b>
Artificial intelligence is a benefit to society, as machines can become more intelligent over time and increase efficiency. In addition, computers are not subject to the same possibility of errors that humans are exposed to. From an energy perspective, artificial intelligence can be used to analyze and search historical data to determine how energy loads are efficiently distributed from a network perspective.
<b><li>It benefits multiple industries</li></b>
The community has benefited and will continue to benefit from artificial intelligence that is based on personal / face recognition, digital content analysis and accuracy in determining patterns, whether they are used in health sciences, scientific research, or technology applications. The risks of artificial intelligence are real if we do not understand the quality of the data received and set the rules of artificial intelligence that make accurate barter decisions at increasing computing speeds.
<b><li>It relieves humans of all responsibility</li></b> 
Using machine learning to predict and help solve problems is one thing; But it is quite another thing that we use these systems to intentionally control and act in ways that make people unnecessary. When robot intelligence exceeds our ability to comprehend it, or it becomes superior intelligence, we must ensure that we do not blindly follow its recommendation and absolve ourselves of all responsibility.
<b><li>It extends and expands creativity</li></b>
Artificial intelligence is the greatest opportunity in our lives to extend and expand human creativity and innovation. The two main concerns that promoters raise for fear is that artificial intelligence will lead to job losses in society and artificial intelligence will become evil and take over the human race. I believe that each of these concerns raised by critics is a matter of discussion or solvable.
